# PassObfuscator


Obfuscates a given "seed" string to produce another deterministic one suitable for a password.
For example, use "2018gmail" as the seed for your gmail password, "2018github" as the seed for your github account, etc.
The pattern is your own, and then you don't need gigabytes of brain to remember all your passwords.

_Warning_: very weak obfuscation function, probably easy to find its inverse.
